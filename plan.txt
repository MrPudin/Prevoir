INTRODUCTION
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This document describes how the app will work, including a user story, sorting
algorithms and pseudocode and finally a work schedule.

USER STORY
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Tutorial
The first time the user opens the app, there is a tutorial that explains how
the app works:
    - 

| Schedule Tab (main)
The user opens the app and sees a scroll view of the tasks to do for the day.
The scroll view shows tasks and void blocks.

The tasks are displayed with a the start time at the top left of task, the
subject name at the bottom of the task. The task name and task description are
on the left of the two items, both of which are ellipsized when it is too
long.

The void blocks are displayed with a start and stop time.

The bottom of the screen shows that he is at a schedule tab. There are two
other tabs which he can select settings and tasks.

1. Refresh Button/ Shake to Refresh (random sort)

Immediately resorts the tasks randiomly and redisplays to the user.

2. Add a task
    Adds tasks to storage and immediately schedules the subtasks
    The user is returned to the previous view. 
    
    a. type
    b. Name
    c. Task Description
    d. duration_needed
    e. Deadline
    f. recommended_timee

3. Go to settings
    A Scroll View with settings:

    a. Set Void blocks/Time blocks > Scroll View with list of editable Time Blocks/Void Blocks
    b. Enable disable shake to refresh > Toggle Button/Switch
    c. Gradual or Even Sorting > Toggle Button/Switch

4. Go to tasks
    A Scroll View with Tasks. Tasks are displayed with minimuium information such as name and subject emplisised if too long.
   
    - Search Bar
    a. All Incomplete Tasks
    b. Completed Today Tasks

HOW TO SORT
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Properties
Task
    - Due date (and time)
    - Duration needed
    - Type (onetime or repetitive)
    - User recommended time
Timeblocks
    - Time start
    - Time end
    - Duration

| Pseudocode for each task
let num_timeblock = number of timeblocks before task due date
# Get total time to schedule
set total_time_to_schedule = 0
for each time block:
    total_time_to_schedule += timeblock.duration

# If it is gradual
if split_even is false
    # get the amount of time to set
    set time_to_set = max(task.recommended_time,
                          (task.duration_needed**2)/total_time_to_schedule)
    set time_to_set_per_timeblock = time_to_set/num_timeblock

    set carry_over = 0
    while time_to_set > 0:
        for each timeblock:
            # If the time block is used up
            if time_block.filled:
                continue

            # Add carry_over
            if carry_over shorter than (<) timeblock.duration:
                add carry_over to timeblock
                set timeblock.duration -= carry_over
            else:
                set carry_over += time_to_set_per_timeblock -
                                  timeblock.duration
                fill timeblock.duration
                continue

            if time_to_set_per_timeblock shorter than (<) timeblock.duration:
                add task to timeblock
                set timeblock.duration -= time_to_set_per_timeblock
                set time_to_set -= time_to_set_per_timeblock
            else:
                set carry_over = time_to_set_per_timeblock - 
                                 timeblock.duration
                set time_to_set -= timeblock.duration
                fill timeblock.duration
# Evenly split
else:
