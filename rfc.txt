While reading the code for the Android project, I found some questionable
methods lying around in the DateTime class:

DateTime.getMillis() - The class description only mentions that the 
accuracy if the data type is only down to the minute however this outputs
date/time in milli-seconds.

DateTime.setHasDate()
DateTime.setHasTime() - These setters set Status Variables (Variables
that vary according to current data). What if someone called on of 
these methods while internal datetime did not have time? At Least make
them private.

Also the Duration class should not be Deprecated and should at least
acts as an abstraction for the current class used (org.joda.time.Period).
