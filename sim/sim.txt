----- Skeem Simulator Design Document -----
[About]
This document describes the design of the simulator used to test algorithms
for Skeem as to determine their usability in the development of the application.
This simulator is inspired by:
https://github.com/sausheong/founders/blob/master/founders.ipynb

The simulator runs implementation of the scheduling algorithms over random or
predefined data and generates statistics over their their 
- quaility of output (generated schedule), 
- time taken/memory used 
- scalability (ie how it scales over large data sets.)
The simulator would also produce data that can be used to benchmark algorithms 
against each other. This allows us to determine an optimal algorithm for the 
Scheduler in Skeem.

skeem.py - Data Model Objects replicating the ones to be implemented in Skeem
    -- Objects -- Ref: doc/object.txt
    1. Task 
    2. Break
    3. Scheduler
    4. Repetition
    5. Tag
sim.py - Generates data sets and runs thems over the algorithms, recording 
         statistics and storing them in a file
display.py - Display statistics files generated by sim.py in a visual plotted
             format that faciliates the analysis of data.
algorithm.py - Implementations of the algorithms to be benchmarked and tested.
