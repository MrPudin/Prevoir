Description: Unexpected Error: Invalid Time Given error given when user sets 
dates before current time even when user has set the repeat option. Only occurs

Is it a voidblock or task?
For both cases, this is likely to be because the repeated days are not set,
hence, the program still does not count the task/voidblock as repetitive,
therefore, the restrictions are still in place. I tried reproducing the error
to no avail. Is there a calendar?

It only happens when repeated days is set for the first time when creating a 
void block. The calendar still appears. What I expected was the repeated 
flag being set as soon as the switch is toggled. In the onClick method of the 
switch you need to tell the application that the void block is repetitive
even before you save the task/void block for the first time.

This issue has been resolved as a UI feature. UI Fixed to show voidblock
repeats more clearly by moving it below name.

[Bug 4]
Severity: LOW
Status: CLOSED
Description: Unexpected UI: Calendar to select date is shown even when task in
repetitive. Only occurs when first creating void block
Expected: No Calendar should be shown, because dates  would set using 'set 
repeated days'
Reproduction:
1. Create a new void block.
2. Toggle repeat switch
3. Set begin/end dates
4. Observe that you have to set a calendar

Same as Bug 3, is it a voidblock or task? Most likely because you have not set
the repeated days, the voidblock or task is not counted as repeated. Hence, it
still shows the calendar.
