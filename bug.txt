[[BUG TRACKING]]
[Bug 3]
Severity: MEDIUM
Status: PENDING CLOSE
Description: Unexpected Error: Invalid Time Given error given when user sets 
dates before current time even when user has set the repeat option. Only occurs
on when first creating void block
Expected: No error when creating a repetitive task.
Reproduction:
1.Create a new repetitive void block with time starting earlier than the current
  time
2.Try To Save
3.Fail due to error.
---------------
Is it a voidblock or task?
For both cases, this is likely to be because the repeated days are not set,
hence, the program still does not count the task/voidblock as repetitive,
therefore, the restrictions are still in place. I tried reproducing the error
to no avail. Is there a calendar?

[Bug 4]
Severity: LOW
Status: PENDING CLOSE
Description: Unexpected UI: Calendar to select date is shown even when task in
repetitive. Only occurs when first creating void block
Expected: No Calendar should be shown, because dates  would set using 'set 
repeated days'
Reproduction:
1. Create a new void block.
2. Toggle repeat switch
3. Set begin/end dates
4. Observe that you have to set a calendar
---------------
Same as Bug 3, is it a voidblock or task? Most likely because you have not set
the repeated days, the voidblock or task is not counted as repeated. Hence, it
still shows the calendar.
